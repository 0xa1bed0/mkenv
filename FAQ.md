# License FAQ (Elastic License 2.0)

This document clarifies what you can and cannot do with mkenv under the
Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2).

---

## ✔ Is mkenv free?

Yes — completely free:
- for individuals  
- for companies  
- for teams  
- for all internal development and build workflows  

You may deploy mkenv across your whole organization without paying.

---

## ✔ Can I use mkenv at my job?

Yes.  
Individual or team use at your workplace is always allowed.

---

## ✔ Can a company deploy mkenv company-wide?

Yes.  
ELv2 allows full internal use, including automated and organization-wide usage.

---

## ❌ What am I *not* allowed to do?

Under ELv2, you may **not**:

- Sell mkenv
- Sell a fork of mkenv
- Offer mkenv as SaaS or a managed service
- Integrate mkenv into a commercial product
- Build a commercial competitor using mkenv

These restrictions prevent commercial exploitation of the project.

---

## ✔ Can I fork mkenv?

Yes — as long as the fork is not:
- sold commercially  
- offered as a service  
- embedded in a commercial tool  
- used to create a competing commercial product  

---

## ✔ Why Elastic License instead of MIT/Apache?

Because ELv2:
- allows full use for both individuals and companies  
- protects mkenv from being monetized by third parties  
- ensures competitors cannot clone the project and sell it  
- still allows the community to fork, contribute, and use freely  

This matches the project’s philosophy.

## 🏢 What is mkenv Enterprise?

A separate proprietary edition, with:
- centralized policies  
- team environment orchestration  
- security controls  
- enterprise workflows  
- integrations  
- support  

This repo contains **only** the free open-source base.
